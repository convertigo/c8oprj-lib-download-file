      The shared action <b>getFile</b> is used to trigger a download file in a Convertigo NGX Application.<br>
      Drag and Drop the <b>getFile</b> shared action in an event (onClick of a button, for example) and set the <b>file _path</b> variable to the path of the file to download from Convertigo Server filesystem and the <b>target_sequence</b> variable to your main sequence.
