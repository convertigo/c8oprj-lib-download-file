    'This library will enable your applications to download files held on Convertigo server.
    
    ## Purpose
    In many applications, it is useful to provide buttons or links to trigger a download of a file (PDF, Document, Photo etc ... ) generated or held on a file system accessible by a Convertigo server. By default, Convertigo can only serve files located in the project workspace, without controlling access to these file. If you want to serve files located outside the workspace and want a fined grained control with some business logic to enable or not the download, you should use this library.
    
    ## Usage
    The back-end part of the library is the **get_file** sequence. This is a **private** sequence so it cannot be called directly by a client. You must create your own sequence controlling the business logic and if the user is enabled to do so call the **get_file** sequence within you own custom sequence.
    
    The library provides a sample **demo_lib_usage** showing this
    
    On the Front-end side, you must trigger a file download by calling this custom sequence. To do so the library  provides a **getFile** SharedAction you can use within your project. A Sample application with a "Download File" button is provided showing how to call this Shared Action from your project.

      The shared action <b>getFile</b> is used to trigger a download file in a Convertigo NGX Application.
      
      Drag and Drop the <b>getFile</b> shared action in an event (onClick of a button, for example) and set the <b>file_path</b> variable to the path of the file to download from Convertigo Server file system and the <b>target_sequence</b> variable to a sequence performing the necessary business logic to control whenever or not the user is enabled to download a file prior to call the librari's **get_file** Sequence.
